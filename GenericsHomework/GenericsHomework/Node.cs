     * When the garbage collector starts running, it makes the assumption that all objects in the heap are garbage. 
     * In other words, it assumes that none of the application's roots refer to any objects in the heap. Now, the 
     * garbage collector starts walking the roots and building a graph of all objects reachable from the roots. 
     * For example, the garbage collector may locate a global variable that points to an object in the heap. 
     * 
     * Figure 2 shows a heap with several allocated objects where the application's roots refer directly to objects 
     * A, C, D, and F. All of these objects become part of the graph. When adding object D, the collector notices 
     * that this object refers to object H, and object H is also added to the graph. The collector continues to
     * walk through all reachable objects recursively.
     * 
     * Once this part of the graph is complete, the garbage collector checks the next root and walks the objects again. 
     * As the garbage collector walks from object to object, if it attempts to add an object to the graph that 
     * it previously added, then the garbage collector can stop walking down that path. This serves two purposes. 
     * First, it helps performance significantly since it doesn't walk through a set of objects more than once. 
     * Second, it prevents infinite loops should you have any circular linked lists of objects.
